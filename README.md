Project Steps and Team Contributions

Load Data
Contributor: Ivan Kitakule
Loaded the initial dataset required for the project.
Ensured data integrity and handled any loading issues.

Data Preprocessing
Contributor: Ivan Kitakule
Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and outliers.
Normalized and standardized the data for better performance of machine learning models.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate Visualization Contributor: Arnold Beeka 
Conducted univariate analysis to understand the distribution of individual variables.
Visualized the data using histograms, box plots, and bar charts.

Multivariate Analysis Contributor: Gerald Bwanika
Explored relationships between multiple variables.
Created scatter plots, pair plots, and correlation heatmaps to identify significant relationships.

Insights from the Data
Contributor: Gerald Bwanika
Summarized key insights from the EDA.
Highlighted the influence of factors such as parental support, attendance, and extracurricular activities on students' GPA.

Machine Learning Modelling
Contributor: Arnold Beeka
Implemented various machine learning models to predict student GPA.
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

Linear Regression Analysis
Residual Analysis Contributor: Arnold Beeka
Analyzed the residuals of the linear regression model.
Plotted residuals to check for patterns and ensure model assumptions were met.

Coefficient Insights Contributor: Arnold Beeka
Interpreted the coefficients of the linear regression model.
Explained the impact of each feature on the predicted GPA.

Neural Network
Contributor: Gerald Bwanika
Designed and implemented a neural network model for predicting GPA.
Fine-tuned the neural network architecture and hyperparameters to improve performance.

Summary and Recommendations
Contributor: Gerald Bwanika
Compiled the final insights and recommendations based on the analysis and modelling results.
Suggested interventions and strategies to improve student performance based on the findings.
